    "We can straightforwardly compute the wavefunction for a single electron atomic orbital, such as the 2p orbital, by specifying the quantum numbers `n`, `l`, and `m`.\n",
    "We can then visualise the desnity associated with this wavefunction in 3D. We have two simple functions to do this, one which will plot the individual points (of the grid on which the wavefunction is evaluated) and one which will use the marching cubes algorithm to plot an isosurface.\n",
    "\n",
    "These wavefunctions can be evaluated and plotted in either Cartesian or spherical coordinates, depending on the desire of the user, by beginning with the appropriate `Wavefunction` object. Either `datatypes.CartesianWavefunction` or `datatypes.RadialWavefunction`. Both classes implement the same interface, so the user can choose which one they prefer, though for plotting purposes, the Cartesian wavefunction is more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the wavefunction is done by calling the `eval_wavefunction` method on the `Wavefunction` object, which will compute the wavefunction on a grid of points. This can be expensive for higher resolutions, so this code also implements 3D interpolation. This allows the user to evaluate the wavefunction on a coarse grid and then interpolate to a finer grid for plotting. "
