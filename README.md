ToDo:

- Validate/Verify the energy, can we implement something like LDA to compute the energy of the orbitals from the density and compare to the analytical value?
- More checks and tests
     - Confirm indexing, possible rotation of functions? 
     - Testing on energy
     - test based on known behaviour of quantum numbers
- get layered orbitals for elements based on quantum number?
     - Plot in an array something like the periodic table?
- Plot 2d slices through the centre of the density to plot contour plot properly
- Use Panda3d to do 3d rendering of orbtials in an interactive mode?
